I co-developed this in the [original repo](https://github.com/veterinara39/Veterinara-AI-Transcription). This fork exists to showcase my contributions.

This repository contains the prototype code for **Veterinära**, an AI system that transcribes and formats veterinary consultations into structured medical records.
